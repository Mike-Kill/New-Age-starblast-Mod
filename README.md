 New-age mod version 1 

  What is the New-Age Mod? New-Age Mod was originally created when I was remodeling the entire 
  Vanilla ship tree for Capture the Flag, but then got the idea to combine both KEST and Starberry Mod
  into 1 single mod. So, I ended up creating an entire new ship tree in hopes it will
  be used in future AOWs and Games of the Night.
 

Finished: The ship tree, alien spawners and asteroid spawners
 

The plan: 
  1. Special ship abilities, these abilities functions similar to Starblast Prototypes
  2. Alien station; a huge alien station at the center of the map and functions as an arena
  3. Lore :)


New update:
 1.Ship Regen buff and slight balancing
 2.New alien strenght and alien wave function
